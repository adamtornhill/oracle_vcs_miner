# oracle_vcs_miner

A one-off quick hack command line tool to extract version-control data from SQL scripts exported from an oracle database.

## Usage

This program was developed to parse proprietary format and is of little general use. Since the input format was quite inconsistent, the parser has to be very relaxed and lets some odd stuff through. However, that was good enough in this case.
